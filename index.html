    My name is Tabor Wondimu, I am from Ethiopia. I attended the University of California, San Diego, where I obtained my Bachelor's in Global Health. While majoring in Global Health, I was exposed to different programming languages and computational concepts
    such as C++, Discrete Math and Java. I was eager to further my skillset in the software field so I ended up taking advanced computer science courses in theory of computation and data structures. Upon graduating
    I enrolled in TrueCoders where I learned the fundemenatals of Full-Stack Software Engineering using C#, SQL, ASP.Net, CSS, HTML, JavaScript and .NET Core.

        VerityStream - A Healthstream Company
         <p>
            Used Microsoft SQL (MySQL) and Excel to perform data entry, data search, data removing, data validation, and adding data of clients across the platform by writing various scripts.
            Clients included hospitals, medical schools, medical professionals, and insurance companies. I would complete a thorough analysis of these entities and completed an excel worksheet noting the results and then updating them within the companies database.
            Assigned various specific codes to companies and schools as well as individuals, in accordance with the guideline set by VerityStream. This was referred to as code conversion.
            Worked alongside the software engineering team to upload client details and updates into servers. This was completed by submitting an excel sheet to the software engineering team with lists of entities that either needed to be added, deleted, or updated within the company system.
